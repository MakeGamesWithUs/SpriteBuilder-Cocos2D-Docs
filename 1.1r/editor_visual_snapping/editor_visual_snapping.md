#Activating Snapping

By selecting *Document* -> *Snap* snapping for all nodes can be activated and deactivated:

Further a developer can specify with types of snapping should be activated. SpriteBuilder supports snapping to:

- Nodes 
- Grid
- Guides

This option is available through the menu: *Document* -> *Snap To*:

Snapping to the grid can only be activated when the grid is visible.

###Snapping to other nodes
SpriteBuilder uses a special visualization to show a developer that a node is snapping to another node:

For snapping to grids and guides no special visualization is used since both are visual lines already.
