#What are SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D

Cocos2D is the most popular framework for building 2D games for mobile devices.  It is open source, extremely powerful, and has a vibrant community of developers.  Programming games in Cocos2D is even faster and easier when you use SpriteBuilder, a visual editor for Cocos2D games.  Spritebuilder allows you to create menues, design physics and particle systems, and create sprite animations using a simple drag-and-drop interface that takes the guess work out of connecting the visual and programatic elements of your game.  Together they make the process of taking a 2D mobile game from conception to marketplace more quickly than you ever thought possible.

Some of the main principles that underly Cocos2D are:

##Free & Open-Source
Open-source, MIT licence, commercially friendly, compatible with both closed and open source games.  If you encounter a bug, or want to add a new feature, you don't have to wait a year until the next update, you can go look at the source.

##Easy to Use
Cocos2D has a clean API, [great documentation](link to documentation), an active, friendly community, and a large number of examples and tutorials for free online.

##Crazy Fast
With only a thin layer between the Cocos2D and the highly-optimized OpenGL ES 2 renderer, your game will run smoothly under even the most strenuous of simulations.

##Flexible
Cocos2D is easy to extend and works with all of Appleâ€™s native APIs and most third party libraries.

##Proven for Top-Quality Games
Used to build [thousands of games](www.cocos2d-x.org/games), Cocos2D has been used to create many best-selling games on both the App Store and on Google Play.

##Cross-Platform
Build your games natively at top speed in Objective-C for iOS and Android (via Apportable)


#What's in this guide
This documentation is a starter guide for developing mobile games with SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D. This developer guide will give you an overview of the features available in SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D 3.0. Where applicable we will point you to tutorials that demonstrate how to use the new features with practical examples.

The guide is broken down into two main sections.  The first will teach you the basics of how a game engine works and how to use SpriteBuilder to create the visual components of your game.  The second half will then show you how to connect these visual components in code using Cocos2D in order to create fully functional games.

#What you should know already
If you have not already downloaded and installed Xcode, the IDE for Objective-C and Swift, you can download it [here.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12)  While this guide will cover all of the conceptual basics of game engines and the Cocos2D api, it will be helpful to have some background programming experience. If you haven't programmed before, be sure to look at some of the [tutorials](link) in parallel with this documentation, as they will provide a guided introduction to coding games.
