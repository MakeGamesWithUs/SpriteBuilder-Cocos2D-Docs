#Programatically Altering Physics

One of the most powerful features of SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D is their use of the Chipmunk physics engine in order to simulate physics within games.  SpriteBuilder provides a visual interface for creating physics based simulations which follow the traditional laws of physics, however there are often times where physical properties need to be modified as the game progresses in order to create otherworldly physical effects.  Cocos2D provides a fixed update loop for physical interactions which can be tapped into programatically.  Combining this with the ability to apply forces and create joint and collision connections programatically, and it is possible to create any interaction imaginable through code.
