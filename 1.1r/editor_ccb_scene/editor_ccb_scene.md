#Scene CCBs

Scenes serve as the primary containers for game content.  You will likely want to create a new scene for each menue and level in your game unless you are using SubCCBs to replace portions of levels (link to PeevedPenguins tutorial)

Scenes are loaded into play by the Game Director as described in the section on the structure of a game (link to other page in documentation).
