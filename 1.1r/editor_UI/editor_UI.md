#Familiarizing yourself with the SpriteBuilder Interface

SpriteBuilder is designed to feel familiar to individuals who have previously worked with XCode, featuring a centeral work area, document and asset managment on the left side, property panel on the right, and a timeline editor along the bottom where the console and log would normally be.  This section will give an in-depth look at these various panels, and how to use them to create games.

The interface is divided into 4 main sections:

1. **Resource/Component Browser:** Provides a list of different resources and scenes that have been created or added to the project. The component tab provides different types of Nodes that can be dragged to the scene.
2. **Stage:** The stage previews the current scene. Here all of the Nodes that belong to a scene can be arranged.
3. **Timeline:** The timeline is used to create animations within SpriteBuilder. It also provides an overview of the scene hierarchy.
4. **Detail View:** Once a node within the scene has been selected, this detail view will display a lot of editable information about that node. It allows developers to modify positions, content (the text of a label, for example) and physics properties.
