#Using Option-Click to work with the timeline
When working on the timeline editor to create animations or audio effects, there are a number of different keyboard shortcuts that you can learn and use in order to instantly create a new keyframe or audio instance.  However, you also have the option of using a universal option-click method to create new instances.  For animation properties, simply expand the node, and option click on the feature you want anywhere on the timeline and a keyframe will be created for you there.  Similarly, if you click anywhere on the Sound effects timeline it will create a new audio instance, which you can assign a sound source into.
