#Resources: OpenGL

OpenGL is an open source graphics rendering API, and is one of the industries most widely used.  The API provides a high-level cross platform and programming language method to interact with graphics hardware.  By abstracting the API away from specific implementation details, programmers can use the API to implement applications across multiple platforms and languages.

Cocos2D supports OpenGL ES1 and ES2 for rendering.  While Cocos2D will handle rendering for you, if you would like to learn more about OpenGL there is a wide body of existing documentaiton and tutorials both online and in print.
