# Android Development

SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D can be used to build, run, and deploy Objective-C apps on Android devices. The cross-compiling technology provided by [Apportable](http://www.apportable.com/) enables you to run iOS apps on Android devices at native speed without having to write any Java or C++ code.

Refer to the [SpriteBuilder Android Plugin Documentation](http://android.spritebuilder.com) for more details.
