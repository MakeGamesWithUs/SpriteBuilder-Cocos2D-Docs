#User Interfaces in Cocos2D

The recommended way of creating User Interfaces in Cocos2D is using the UI components that Cocos2D provides:

- `CCButton`
- `CCTextField`	
- `CCLabelTTF`, `CCLabelBMFont`
- `CCSlider`
- `CCScrollView` 
- `CCTableView`

Cocos2D can be combined with UIKit, however in most cases using the Cocos2D components will result in a better user experience. In almost all cases SpriteBuilder should be used to setup user interfaces.
