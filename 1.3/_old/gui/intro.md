# Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design

SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D provide their own GUI components. For instance buttons, sliders, box layout, scroll view and other GUI nodes.

While you can use UIKit views as well to design your user interface, the built-in GUI nodes are generally faster and can be easily adapted to match your app's visual design. 

The built-in GUI nodes can be animated just like any other node and will follow their parent node's animations and are removed automatically when presenting a new scene. That's just some of the things UIKit controls will not do automatically.
