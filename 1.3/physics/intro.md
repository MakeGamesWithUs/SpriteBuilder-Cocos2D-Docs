# Physics

SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D use the [Chipmunk2D physics engine](https://chipmunk-physics.net/). The Cocos2D integration provides an Objective-C programming interface while SpriteBuilder offers visual editing of physics shapes and joints, and their properties.

You will learn how to add physics to your game in this section.
