# Animations

This section covers animation of nodes via Actions, Sprite Frame animations, Scene transitions and other animation topics.

## Table of Contents

- [Working with Actions](./animation/actions) focuses on how to use actions in code. Actions are the driving force behind Timeline animations. SpriteBuilder users may want to read the [Timeline](./spritebuilder/timeline-and-node-tree) and [Keyframe Editor](./spritebuilder/keyframe-editor) articles in addition to *Working with Actions*.
- [Scene Transitions](./animation/scene-transitions) explains how to change scenes in code, using transition animations provided by Cocos2D, rounded off with tips on how and when to implement a *Loading* scene.
- [SpriteFrame Animations](./animation/spriteframe-animation) illustrates what sprite frame animations are, when and when not to use them, how to create a spriteframe animation in SpriteBuilder as well as programmatically creating a spriteframe animation using Cocos2D.
