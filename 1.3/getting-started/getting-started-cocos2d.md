# First Steps with Cocos2D

<table border="0"><tr><td width="48px" bgcolor="#ffd0d0"><strong>Caution</strong></td><td bgcolor="#ffd0d0">
Skip this guide if you are using SpriteBuilder. You should only read this guide if you <strong>expressly decided not to use SpriteBuilder</strong>. You will have to write program code for everything and manage your resource files (assets) manually.
