# Development Requirements

- The SpriteBuilder app requires **OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)** or newer.

- To create apps with SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D you need to use **Xcode 5 or newer**. We recommmend using the latest Xcode version available on the Mac App Store.

- An [Apple Registered Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership is **not required but highly recommended** for iOS development to be able to test on an actual device.

The iOS Simulator included with Xcode has a severely limited rendering performance (it's a software renderer) and does not emulate hardware sensors like accelerometer or gyroscope. Hence our recommendation to develop and test on actual devices.
