# Development Requirements

SpriteBuilder requires **OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)**.

To create apps with SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D you need to have **Xcode 5 or newer** installed. The latest Xcode version is available for [free on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835). [Older versions of Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?q=xcode) are available for download to registered developers.

An [Apple Registered Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership is **not required but highly recommended** for iOS development ($99/year). 

Being a registered iOS Developer enables you to deploy apps to iOS devices. This is particularly important because the iOS Simulator included with Xcode has extremely limited rendering performance (software renderer) and can very quickly become unsuitable, if not entirely unusable, for game development needs.

## Deployment Targets

- iOS apps: Can be deployed on all iOS devices capable of running iOS 5.1 or newer. The original iPhone and iPhone 3G and corresponding iPod Touch devices are not supported.
- OS X apps: Will run on OS X 10.9 or newer.
- Android apps: *(requirements not yet announced)*
