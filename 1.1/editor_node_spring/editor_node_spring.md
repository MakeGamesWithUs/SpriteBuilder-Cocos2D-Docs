#Spring Joints

- `Rest length:`  By default the rest length is set to be the starting length of the spring as displayed on screen.  If rest length is enabled it is possible to make the initial length of the spring different from the rest length of the spring, resulting in the bodies being pulled together if the rest length is shorter than the initial length, and pushed apart if the rest length is longer than the initial length.

- `Damping:`   Specifies the amount of energy lost as the spring undulates.

- `Stiffness:`  Specifies the strength of the spring.  A high stiffness will result in a high resistance against motion and a lot of force when a spring is released.
