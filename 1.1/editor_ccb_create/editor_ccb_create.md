# Working with ccb files

SpriteBuilder structures games in ccb files. CCB files can represent scenes and different kinds of node graphs. CCB files store information about positions and properties of different nodes (including physics properties). Additionally ccb files can store information about animations.

I most cases each scene in a game created with SpriteBuilder is represented by its own ccb file. The default SpriteBuilder project comes with a *MainScene.ccb* that is setup to be the initial ccb file.

## Creating ccb files
A new ccb file can be created by selecting *New > File...* from the *File* menu.
