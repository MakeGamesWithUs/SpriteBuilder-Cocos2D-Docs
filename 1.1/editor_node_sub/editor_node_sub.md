#Including CCB files in a scene
One of the most powerful ways to build scenes and levels in SpriteBuilder is to use CCB Files.  By building
systems and interactions within CCB files you can make as many instances in the game as you like, and change them all simply by altering the CCB file.  For more information about working with CCB files see [this portion](link) of the docmunentation.

To include CCB files in scenes, either drag them directly from the asset library onto the stage, or use the Sub File from the node library and specify a source CCB file.  The contents of a Sub File can also be specified in code, an extremely powerful feature.For an example of how this can be used to load different levels into a scene, see [this tutorial](link to peeved penguins)
