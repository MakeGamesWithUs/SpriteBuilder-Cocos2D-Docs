# Guides and Sticky Notes
Guides and sticky notes have no effect when loaded into your app but can make it easier to align objects or save comments for other developers or designers working in the ccb-file.

To create a new guide, drag it out from the bottom or left side ruler. To move it, hold down the command key while dragging it. You can remove a guide by dragging it out of the visible area.

Sticky notes are created by choosing *Add Sticky Note* from the *View* menu. Edit or remove the sticky note by double clicking it.
