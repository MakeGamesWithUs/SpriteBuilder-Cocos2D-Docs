#Working with generic Nodes
When you drag a node onto the stage from the node library it has almost no properties associated with it.  A basic node provides the underlying structure for every other type in the node library, but when used directly it is essentially just a container.  One of the most common uses for nodes is to serve as a folder for other nodes.  It allows nodes to be grouped together and hidden/shown in unison within the timeline.
