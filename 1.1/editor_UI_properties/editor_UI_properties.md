#Inspector

The first tab of the Detail View (labelled as section 4 in the above image) is the Inspector. Once a node on the stage is selected this panel can be used to to modify many of its properties, like position and color:

The properties that affect position, scale, rotation and skew of the selected node can be edited visually in the canvas area. To move a node simply select it and drag it around, to change scale, rotation and skew manipulate the corners and edges of the node. To edit the anchor point of a node, grab it and drag it.

###Code Connections

The second tab on the right panel is used to manage code connections for selected node. One of the things that can be done here is setting custom Objective-C classes for a node:
