#Creating a Gradient Node

A gradient node is similar to a color node except that it can be assigned two colors instead of one, and you can control how these two colors blend together.  The starting and ending color and opacity control what the gradient fades between, and the X/Y vector at the bottom of the panel controls the direction in which the gradient is applied

A positive x vector creates a gradient that starts towards the right of the screen and continues along the negative x axis.  A positive y vector starts towards the top of the screen and continues along the negative y axis.  Setting both the x and y vector will result in an angled vector proportional to the relative strengths of the vectors.
