#Working with multiple Timelines
It's rare that a sprite will need only one animation for the entire game, so SpriteBuilder makes creating new timelines and switching between them extremely easy.  Use the dropdown at the top of the SpriteBuilder timeline and select New Timeline to create a new timeline.  You will automatically be switched to this new, untitled, timeline.  In order to switch between existing timelines, use the timelines pull out and select which timeline you would like to edit.

#Editting Timelines

The editing window can be used to set timeline names and to select which timeline will play when the node is first loaded.  If you do not wish for an animation to play initially, simply set AutoPlay on an empty timeline, and initialize the other timelines from code when necessary (link to XCode portion of documentation that shows how to do this.)
